# Lab 4 Summary
My purpose for making this map is to show the different minimum wages across different states in the US. While many adhere to the federal minimum wage, most states have their own laws regarding wages. Sometimes they are vastly different, the lowest amount being 2 dollars and the highest being 15.50, and I thought a circle scaling map would adequately show the difference. I got the information from the US Department of Labor, and the data on their site is updated to September 2023. For the design, I chose green as the color because I found that it stood out and was appropriate given the theme, and I used a base map with a stark black and white contrast because I personally find those easier to read.
